    "## What is Survival Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective in survival analysis — also referred to as reliability analysis in engineering — is to establish a connection between covariates and the time of an event. The name *survival analysis* originates from clinical research, where predicting the time to death, i.e., survival, is often the main objective. Survival analysis is a type of regression problem (one wants to predict a continuous value), but with a twist. It differs from traditional regression by the fact that parts of the training data can only be partially observed – they are *censored*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider a clinical study, which investigates coronary heart disease and has been carried out over a 1 year period as in the figure below.\n",

    "Patient A was lost to follow-up after three months with no recorded cardiovascular event, patient B experienced an event four and a half months after enrollment, patient D withdrew from the study two months after enrollment, and patient E did not experience any event before the study ended. Consequently, the exact time of a cardiovascular event could only be recorded for patients B and C; their records are *uncensored*. For the remaining patients it is unknown whether they did or did not experience an event after termination of the study. The only valid information that is available for patients A, D, and E is that they were event-free up to their last follow-up. Therefore, their records are *censored*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, each patient record consists of a set of covariates $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ , and the time $t>0$ when an event occurred or the time $c>0$ of censoring. Since censoring and experiencing and event are mutually exclusive, it is common to define an event indicator $\\delta \\in \\{0;1\\}$ and the observable survival time $y>0$. The observable time $y$ of a right censored sample is defined as\n",
